# Tabu Search: Python Implementation for Job Scheduling Optimization

Homework for the Optimization Algorithms course at Universit√† degli Studi di Brescia.

Before applying the Tabu Search algorithm, the optimal solution for the job scheduling problem was found using Gurobi for comparison purposes.

For more details regarding the homework assignment, the Tabu Search implementation, and the results, please refer to the [TabuSearch_Exercise_Report.pdf](TabuSearch_Exercise_Report.pdf) file.

The Python code for the implementation can be found in the [Tabu_Search_exercise.py](Tabu_Search_exercise.py) file. 

- The textual output from a search can be found in [output.txt](output.txt).
- The graph showing the incumbent solution versus the current solution is saved as [tabu_search_progress.png](tabu_search_progress.png).

These files are generated directly by the code.
